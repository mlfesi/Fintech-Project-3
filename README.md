**Executive Summary**

Our team wanted to create a decentralized NFT auction, similar to OpenSea.  We chose to work on creating an auction for designers to 
sell clothing and other fashion accessories to consumers in the Metaverse.  

**Approach**

We began by researching the market for NFTs, and determined that the NFT fashion market was in it's infancy, and projected to grow considerably in the coming years.  We found that some recognizable designers had already successfully sold collections of NFT fashion, in one case an NFT of an iconic Gucci bag sold in a secondary market for a higher price than it's physical retail version.  There is clearly a growing demand for one-of-a-kind digital property, with property managers also promoting development projects by offering NFT artwork with the purchase of condos.

We used OpenSea as a template for our concept as it's functionality was similar to what we needed, but rather than a multi-purpose markeplace, we thought a dedicated and exclusive boutique was best suited to high fashion.  We thought this would be attractive to designers, who would have the ability to regulate access and audience, much like they could at a runway fashion show; and to consumers in replicating the feeling of exclusivity they value in walking in to a high end designer's store.

We were able to build 3 Solidity Contracts to manage auction style transactions, and combine them in to one contract, Market.Sol.  We were able to successfully deploy this contract, and interact with it.  We used Open Zepplin in developing the contract, and Ganache for testing the deployed contract.

**Results**

Our Contracts functioned, but we were not successful in developing a user interface for the market.  We tried to use Streamlit but did not succeed.  If we additional time to work on this project we would:
  - Develop a User Interface
  - Further Develop a Business Plan
